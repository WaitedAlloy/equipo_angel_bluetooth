# flutter_Bluetooth_application.  
A new Flutter project that connects the sensor send by an HC-05 module with Arduino right into a display interface in Flutter for a proof of concept.   
The app measures a simulated ECG physiological variable from an arduino setup, displays the reading in a graph and gives a warning whenever it reaches certain value.
